As a lead designer, I've directed visual design projects for key sections of the Apple website, including the design of [**Apple.com**](https://www.apple.com/)'s first website upon Steve Jobs's return as well as the creation of one of the first iTunes e-commerce apps on Facebook. My work has spanned various domains, such as [**Apple Education**](https://www.apple.com/education/), [**Diversity initiatives**](https://www.apple.com/diversity/), and product sites for [**Final Cut Pro**](https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/) and [**Logic Pro**](https://www.apple.com/logic-pro/).
