As the Director of Product Design, I spearheaded a comprehensive redesign of the platform to better serve musicians and music creators. My role included introducing intuitive features for iPhone and web, developing a robust design system to ensure consistency across the platform, and fostering a vibrant community through the launch of an artists’ network. The project aimed to create a seamless and user-friendly environment tailored to the unique workflows of the music industry, empowering users with tools that enhance collaboration, creativity, and productivity.
